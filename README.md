# A project to create a fictitious employee hierarchy database listed on an interactive website.
`It stems from a fictitious company called Electro (electronic manufacturer)`
- ~~Login Authentication~~ this goes outside the scope of what I wanted to create, so this is scrapped (also not entirely useful in this case)
- ~~Various links~~ have two links currently, one to the hierarchy and one to the contact page
- ~~Optional statistics for employees/website statistics~~ showed employee statistics like years with company or the department, shown in svg boxes
- Optional budgeting page
- ~~MySQL database integration~~ created the mySQL database by sending requests to a server and extracted via .json and read into react app
- ~~Variety of graphical tools from React~~ used trees, svg shapes, checkboxes, etc.
